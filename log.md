# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Today's Progress**: Setting my mind up to the #100DaysOfCode

**Thoughts:** It is a good idea but sometimes you have different priorities to maintain the 100 consecutive days.

### Day 1: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Erd≈ës Number calculation with Dijkstra's algorithm.

**Thoughts**: Always visualize the problem because so you can easily find your misleading thoughts and a valid approach.

### Day 2: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Advent of Code 2016, solved 4 days of puzzles.

**Thoughts**: Think outside the box because sometimes you will really need it. And read the problem description carefully because you will miss important information.

## Day 3: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Advent of Code 2016, day 5 + did some Mars Lander puzzle at CodinGame.

**Thoughts**: Geometry will be needed for other challenges at CodinGame -- it is time to learn something and get the freakin Mars Lander to the ground in safety.
