# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Januray 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Setting my mind up to the #100DaysOfCode

**Thoughts:** It is a good idea but sometimes you have different priorities to maintain the 100 consecutive days.

### Day 1: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Erd≈ës Number calculation with Dijkstra's algorithm.

**Thoughts**: Always visualize the problem because so you can easily find your misleading thoughts and a valid approach.

### Day 2: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Advent of Code 2016, solved 4 days of puzzles.

**Thoughts**: Think outside the box because sometimes you will really need it. And read the problem description carefully because you will miss important information.

## Day 3: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Advent of Code 2016, day 5 + did some Mars Lander puzzle at CodinGame.

**Thoughts**: Geometry will be needed for other challenges at CodinGame -- it is time to learn something and get the freakin Mars Lander to the ground in safety.

## Day 4: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fantastic Bits at CodinGame

**Thoughts**: It was hard to find out how to calculate the next position of the wizards based on the target and thrust. Next time I'll take a look at calculating the next position for other entities where the target / thrust is not known.

## Day 5: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Genome Sequencing at CodinGame

**Thoughts**: Sometimes a simple approach works out better thant the one you think about at first. De Bruijn graphs are good but not every time.

## Day 6: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fantastic Bits at CodinGame

**Thoughts**: Heuristics are good but you need to arrange them in the right order. AI is good but you can be OK without it for a while -- just for the fun of coding.
